# How to prepare Programming Windows 5th Edition source code with CMake to run on Windows 10 
This project is Two in One example - create Win32 Programming examples using Modern Cmake build system and run it. If you are in interest of native programming you needn't leave it out. I want to show you how simple is with Win32 API and CMake to create an efficent light solution and what is more important you can use C++ compiler or IDE of your choice. A project  based on  a source code from Charles Petzold's Programming Windows 5th Edition ISBN-10 157231995X. The work was published in 1998 is one of the famous and comprehensive books of Windows API (Win32). Examples are originally written in pure C language for Windows 98. It's really amazing but after only a few fixes that code is up and running on Windows 10. I tried to make as few as possible changes to the original code. I didn't want fix any warning. It up to you if you care. On the other hand CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. Due to CMake Generator you can get the input files for a native build system like Makefile, Ninja, MsBuild etc. You may set a compiler also. You have to admit that it's very flexible.
# Getting Started

## Prerequisites to run the samples
- Install Cmake and C++ compiler for Windows Platform ( MSVC, Mingw64, Clang ) optionally with IDE ( any Visual Studio 2017, QT Creator, VS Code will be OK ) and have a ball.

- Don't be disappointed when you will try to compile examples for x64 platform, you can do it without any errors but keep in mind that source examples are destined for 16-bit and 32-bit Windows (they are twenty years old) - many of them work without problem but not MIDI example.
